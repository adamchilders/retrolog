Thank you for your interest in contributing to RetroLog! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- Google Gemini API key (for AI features)

### Setup Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd retrolog
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. **Or manual setup**
   ```bash
   # Copy environment file
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   
   # Add your Google Gemini API key to backend/.env
   # Build and start the application
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the existing code style and conventions
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run backend tests (when available)
   docker-compose exec backend python -m pytest
   
   # Run frontend tests
   docker-compose exec frontend npm test
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

### Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### Pull Request Process

1. **Push your branch**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Provide a clear description of the changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - Ensure all tests pass

3. **Code Review**
   - Address any feedback from reviewers
   - Make necessary changes and push updates

## Code Style Guidelines

### Backend (Python)
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused

### Database
- Use descriptive table and column names
- Include proper foreign key relationships
- Add appropriate indexes for performance

## Testing

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
docker-compose exec backend python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
docker-compose exec backend python -m pytest --cov=app
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
# Run tests
docker-compose exec frontend npm test

# Run tests with coverage
docker-compose exec frontend npm test -- --coverage
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update API_DOCUMENTATION.md for API changes
- Add inline code comments for complex logic
- Include examples in documentation
